  This business ran a paper-based register/diary system to track attendance and billing for more than 20 years. I pitched them a prototype system that I designed using google sheets and google apps script. They immediately saw the value it could offer them and commissioned me to build a fully comprehensive management system. I completed the build on time and it is now in use. I started this project with very little coding knowledge and finished it with a strong understanding of HTML, Javascript and Google Apps Script.
